      <h1 class="highlight">About Me Angie!</h1>
      <p>I like to play video games, and I go to church. I have 2 cats, a dog, and a bunny, I like to watch TikTok
    during my free time, and I love shopping. I like to call my boyfriend and facetime him everyday, We watch tiktok
  together, play games, and just talk about how anything that's new. We also read the bible and pray it's important
to me that we have some time with God to help guide us in our relationship. I also like to check up on my online 
friends that I made.</p>


          <h2>My top favorite game</h2>
         <p>My #1 favorite game of all time is Roblox. I love Roblox so much I've been playing
            since I was a wee little Angie back in 2015 was the first time I played Roblox I made so many friends.
            I still play it to this day and I try to find different games to play with friends. I also love to
            dress up my avatar whether it be to troll, cosplay, or to just look cute. I miss the old friends that
            I made when I first started the game. I'm not even gonna talk about how much money I spent on the game.</p>


        <h2>My 2nd favorite game</h2>
            <p>My second favorite game is called Fun Run 4, I used to play Fun Run 3 but found out about 4 through reddit
        and how people hated it. So I decided to give it a try and ended up loving the game, I now play it
        everyday and spent a bit of money on the game ($20). I got my boyfriend to join me in the game, and 
        I even made my own clan in the game and recently people have been joining.</p>


        <h2>My 3rd favorite game</h2>
        <p>My 3rd favorite game to play is called Zombie Catchers, I used to also play that game when I was
            younger my dad was kind enough to buy me things on that game. I still play it to this day to make sure
            my dads money doesn't go to waste, its pretty fun its just a game where you catch zombies and make
            juice out of them while selling them to customers who have no idea what they're ordering. I used to
            play with my brothers and we would race to try and get to the highest level.</p>
